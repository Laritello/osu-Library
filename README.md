# osu-Library
Simple music player for your osu! library.
This project began as my attempt to more or less independently develop software. My skills are far from ideal and i'm still learning, so if you find a mistake (such as bug, logical mistake, etc.) or find my code to be non-optimal, feel free to say about it to me. I will be grateful.
